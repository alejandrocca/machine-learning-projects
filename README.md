  On my way of learning machine learning *pun intended* and theses are projects along the way.

## PyTorch Based MNIST Demo with Linear Model

  10/02/2018
  
  A simple machine learning project with a self-built neural network linear model based on the 
MNIST handwritten number training (60000 samples) and testing datasets (10000 samples.) Training takes 
10 epochs, and each epoch is set with a batch size of 64 samples. The accuracy after 10 epochs reached
96% on my computer.
